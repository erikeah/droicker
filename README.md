# Droicker
AOSP developing from Docker? I think makes sense, all you have to do to start is customize [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to import where download sources and build.

### This it under testing, use at your own risk.

## Main Features.

* New ADB Devices are added automatically.
* Basic tools to build are installed.
* Repo already installed.
* Based in ubuntu:20.04
